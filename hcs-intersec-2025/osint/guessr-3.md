# guessr 3

I thought of Southeast Asia immediately, and looking at the writing I found, I suspected Vietnam.

Searching up DT 317G didn't seem to get me close to anywhere like the picture, so I thought that since the letter G may be an indication of it being a branch of the main road, I tried searching up DT 317G

I continued with trying to find any other clues by going through the entire DT 317 road on street view, which bore no result until I saw something of resemblance from the guessr picture.

The tall hotel's yellow color on the middle was what made me think of it as the same building on the guessr.

After finding the road, I just needed to find the exact spot where the picture was taken
